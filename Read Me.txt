The idea was on logging in, a user was to initialise their own channel,
and have it assigned to them just after clicking the login button. 
(I've deleted the code because it's honestly embarassing with how I was fumbling 
with it,I even tried using pusher and mixed up everything it felt hopeless) next
was to add the code for listening if another user was online to be partnered up with 
and they get directly sent to the chat screen immidiately and start relaying messages
